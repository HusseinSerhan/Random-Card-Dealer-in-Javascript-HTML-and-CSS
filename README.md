# Random Card Generator

## Introduction
Random Card Generator is a simple web application that generates a random card every time the user presses a button. This was my first project using the DOM to manipulate styles, classes, and HTML code using JavaScript during runtime. I created an algorithm that randomly builds a card by selecting an element from a list, which can be a number or an image, and depending on the result, the code applies a different format. This project helped me develop my problem-solving skills and taught me how to think creatively.

### Main Challenge
Although the project is simple at face value, I struggled to get the image of the card to work alongside with the numbers. The challenge was to make sure that the code worked correctly every time the user pressed the button. I had to get creative and use conditionals to ensure that the code would display the image and number correctly.
